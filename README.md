# Obesity-Level-Estimation
Estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition dataset is examined. With four different classification algorithms, it is estimated whether people are obese or not with the data in the dataset. K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree algorithm and Random Forest algorithm were used. Two different encoding methods were applied to the data. These are Label Encoding and One Hot Encoding. Among these algorithms, the algorithm that gives the best score value is the Decision Tree with Label Encoding applied to the data. The algorithm that gives the worst score value is the Decision Tree algorithm with One Hot Encoding applied to the data
